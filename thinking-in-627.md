# about myself
I always talk about things I want to do but failed to prepared myself for them.
I like easy and misc, and hate the diffiult things.But logically speaking, I think one should have a deep seek in one area, or he will be common but not good.So I always hate myself.  
Today I write this to review myself, and I want to insist on writing this every signle day to push myself head forward.Fighting!
