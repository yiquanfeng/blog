# about myself
I always talk about things I want to do but failed to prepared myself for them.
I like simple and miscellaneous tasks, and dislike difficult ones.  
But logically speaking, I think one should focus deeply on a single specific area, otherwise, he will be an average person lacking true skill or mastery.  
So I always hate myself.   
Today I write this to review myself, and I want to insist on writing this every signle day to push myself head forward.Fighting! 


## today's learning unix advanced program
I have read the first chapter of this book, only jump to read  
I learned sth I haved known before, and the inner completion of shell and the command ls and cd 
and there are some miscellaneous things like time, syscall, three file descriptors(stdinput stdoutput stderror), the process and thread and their function like fork waitpid, the user id and the /etc/passwd file, signal process.  
and I think the process, thread, signal process, the three things, can contribute to a rather good shell program.I will try.  
But when I read later, I found the later content is more about the detail.Then I lost my interest.That is the point, I am uninterested in some tupe of detail of a project.And that is the thing I need to do.So today afternoon, I should read one useful detail of file io chapter and complete the whole exercise to full the detail.If I want to extend, I can try to make a shell program myself.That is ok.
