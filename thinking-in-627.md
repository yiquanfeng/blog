# about myself
I always talk about things I want to do but failed to prepared myself for them.
I like simple and miscellaneous tasks, and dislike difficult ones.  
But logically speaking, I think one should focus deeply on a single specific area, otherwise, he will be an average person lacking true skill or mastery.  
So I always hate myself.   
Today I write this to review myself, and I want to insist on writing this every signle day to push myself head forward.Fighting!
